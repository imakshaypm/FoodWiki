FoodWiki is a food spot exploring app which me and my group members did as a mini project. The fuction of this app is to give users an insight of unexplored food spot in there locality rather than 5 star hotels.
This repository consist of frontend and backend of the app we devoloped.
In case of database we used mongoDB.
